This project was written for [Roguebricks](https://roguebricks.de), a German online community of LEGO builders.

We were looking for a new "default" design for small (DIN A5) cards with information about our builds when we would take them to exhibitions - this generator allows us to create them on a whim, customize them to our liking, and download them as PDF to be printed.
